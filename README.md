# UIKitPanGesture
A test project using UIKit pan-gesture on iOS.

## What this project does
With this project you're simply able to drag a rectangle across the screen.

## How to try this project

### Requirements
- Apple developer â€“account
- XCode installed on your system
- Physical iOS-device or XCode's simulator (with iOS 16.1)


### Cloning and opening the project

1. Open terminal and change to your preferred directory.

2. Run `git clone https://github.com/ollitoivanen/UIKitPanGesture`
to clone the project folder to your current location.

3. Go to the project's folder
```
cd UIKitPanGesture/
```

4. Open the .xcodeproj-file
```
open UIKitPanGesture.xcodeproj/
```

5. Run the project from XCode

## Why this project was done
This project was done to discover the possible advantages of using UIKit's implementation of pan gesture over SwiftUIs drag gesture.
While developing a second project it was noticed that on Apple ProMotion displays (120Hz) dragging was noticeably laggy. With UIKits implementation
everything worked as expected. 


## What it taught
In the era of SwiftUI, there are still a great amount of features that need to be implemented with older technologies in order to gain more control over the implementation
